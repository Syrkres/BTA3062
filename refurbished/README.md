# Refurbished
Refurbished is a collection of files for BTA3062 for the **BT Advanced Starters** (your starting mechs).

You get five mechs that have been collected during battle and rebuilt/refurbished to working with eqiupment on hand. They are all under weight and not the most efficient, but when fully reparied will be as good as new.

## Starting Mechs
- Black Hawk (BHKU) either the OE or OF model
- Dervish (DV) 8D (possible medium)
- Griffin (GRF) 2N (possible medium)
- Talso (TLS) 2B with two possible builds.
- Firestart (FS9) either H, J or S model
- Raptor (RTX1) either O or OD model
