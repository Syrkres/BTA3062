# Research Dropship
Collection of files for a new starter background based loosely on the existing improved dropship.

Include the improved Dropship along with four pilots and four Dakota scout vehicles.

### Pilots
- **Eagle Eye** a vehicle pilot
- **Scavenger** a vehicle pilot
- **Panzer Angel** a Space marine mech pilot intended for using Battle Armor (BA)
- **Thorne** a  Space marine mech pilot intended for using Battle Armor (BA)


### Dakota Scout vehicles
Three new Dakota VTOL vehicles to start with designed around scouting. I was thinking of renaming these to match the Warrior VTOL which they are loosely modeled after.
- **Dakota Explorer** VTOL for carrying an BA infantry along with two standard TAGs and increased Range Finder sensors.
- **Dakota Surveyor** VTOL for carrying an BA infantry. The latest Dakota based off of the  explorer, the two standard TAGs are swapped for two Light TAGs with an added Active Probe.
- **Dakota Scout** VTOL for carrying an BA infantry along a singe NARC with 1 ton of ammo
